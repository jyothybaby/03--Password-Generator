<b># 03--Password-Generator</b><br>
This folder contains the html and CSS files for Portfolio homework.
Work I have done for this project is:

In script.js,
1. All arrays initilized for random extraction.\
2. In this program, I have used 2 functions for performing the operations. 
    a. inputCollection();
    b. generatePassword();
3. Collected all inputs for generating the password. 
4. Checked all possible scenarios for input from the user and developed the code accordingly. Used "If - else" statement , different window()functions for input collection function.
5. Used do- while loop and math.random() for generating password as per the user requirement. 
6. displayed the output in the text area.
7. Included Console.log statement in the program to check the values in elements for verification.
8. Tested the code with different Test scenarios like positive teasting, -ve testing, Boundary value analysis etc.


In style.css and html,
1. No change on these files.
2. Style .css moved into "assets" folder.
